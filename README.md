# Password change powershell script

Are you tired of having to change your password every few months?
Most AD domains have the default setting that disallows you to use your most recent passwords, forcing you to keep creating weaker passwords so you can actually remember them. Generally this remembers 24 passwords.

So this script can help: it changes your password 25 times, and afterwards changes your password back to its orignial password, so you never have to remember a crappy weak password again, and you can just use the one actually good password you like and can remember!
